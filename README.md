# End-to-End Deep Learning with MLOps: MLflow, DVC & CI/CD

This project demonstrates an end-to-end deep learning workflow powered by MLOps tools like MLflow, DVC, and CI/CD pipelines. It covers the full lifecycle from data versioning to model training, experiment tracking, and automated deployment.

## Tools & Technologies

MLflow: For experiment tracking and model registry
DVC (Data Version Control): For versioning datasets and pipelines
CI/CD: For automating testing, training, and deployment

## Workflow

1. Update config.ymal
2. Update Secrets.ymal
3. Update params.ymal
4. Update the configuration manger ion src config
5. Update the components
6. Update the pipeline
7. Update the main.py
8. update the dvc.ymal
