# End-to-End Deep Learning with MLOps: MLflow, DVC & CI/CD

This project demonstrates an end-to-end deep learning workflow powered by MLOps tools like MLflow, DVC, and CI/CD pipelines. It covers the full lifecycle from data versioning to model training, experiment tracking, and automated deployment.

## Tools & Technologies

MLflow: For experiment tracking and model registry
DVC (Data Version Control): For versioning datasets and pipelines
CI/CD: For automating testing, training, and deployment
